<h1>Welcome to flight release idiot light!</h1>
<p>This webpage advised if aircraft missions have been released for dummies, like Grant. If the light is on there is an aircraft released that has not been taken by a pilot. If the light is off, there are no aircraft released that are not taken by pilots.</p>
